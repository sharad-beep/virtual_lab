				 <h1>SQL Joins</h1>
				 <p>
				 SQL joins are fundamental operations that allow you to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Joining tables enables you to retrieve data from multiple tables and present it as a single, combined result set. SQL offers various types of joins, each serving different purposes in retrieving data. Let's explore SQL joins in depth:
<br></br>
Basic Join Types:<br></br>
<br></br>
INNER JOIN:<br></br>
<br></br>
The most common join type.<br></br>
Returns only the rows where there is a match between the columns in both tables.<br></br>
The result set includes only the common values from both tables.<br></br>
LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN):<br></br>

Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.<br></br>
If there's no match in the right table, NULL values are included for columns from the right table.<br></br><br></br>
RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN):<br></br>

Similar to a LEFT JOIN, but returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.<br></br>
If there's no match in the left table, NULL values are included for columns from the left table.<br></br><br></br>
FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN):<br></br>

Returns all rows from both tables, including matches and non-matches.<br></br>
If there's no match in either table, NULL values are included for the non-matching side.<br></br><br></br>
Advanced Join Types:<br></br>
<br></br>
SELF JOIN:<br></br>

A join where a table is joined with itself.<br></br>
Useful for comparing rows within the same table, often using aliases to differentiate between the instances of the table.<br></br>
CROSS JOIN (CARTESIAN JOIN):<br></br>

Generates all possible combinations of rows from two or more tables.<br></br>
Usually results in a large number of rows, which can be impractical with large tables.<br></br><br></br>
NATURAL JOIN:<br></br>

Automatically matches columns with the same name in both tables.<br></br>
It's important to be cautious with this join, as changes in column names can lead to unexpected behavior.<br></br><br></br>
JOIN with USING Clause:<br></br>

Similar to a natural join, but you explicitly specify the columns to be used for matching.<br></br>
Helps avoid ambiguities that might arise from same-named columns in different tables.<br></br><br></br>
JOIN with ON Clause:<br></br>

The most flexible type of join.<br></br>
Uses a condition specified in the ON clause to determine which rows to combine.<br></br>
You can use any valid condition to control the matching behavior.<br></br><br></br>
Example:<br></br>

Consider two tables: "Customers" and "Orders." We'll use these tables to illustrate different types of joins:<br></br>
<br></br>
Customers Table:

				 </p>
				
			  </div>
			</div>
		  </div>
		</Layout>
	</div>
  )
}
