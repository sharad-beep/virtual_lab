			 <p><h1>Aim of Studying Transactions in DBMS</h1>
			 <br></br>
The aim of studying transactions in Database Management Systems (DBMS) is to understand the concepts, principles, and mechanisms behind transaction management. This knowledge equips individuals with the skills to design, implement, and maintain reliable and robust database systems that can handle concurrent operations while ensuring data integrity and consistency.
<br></br><br></br><br></br>
<h1>Objectives of Studying Transactions in DBMS:</h1>
<br></br>
1. Understand Transaction Basics:<br></br>
   - Gain a foundational understanding of what transactions are and how they work within a DBMS.
   <br></br><br></br>
2. Ensure Data Integrity:<br></br>
   - Learn how transactions play a crucial role in maintaining data integrity by ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state, even in the presence of failures.
   <br></br><br></br>
3. Achieve ACID Properties:<br></br>
   - Understand the four key properties of transactions: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID), and learn how to design and manage transactions to adhere to these principles.
   <br></br><br></br>
4. Handle Concurrent Access:<br></br>
   - Learn techniques to manage concurrent access to the database by multiple users or applications without causing conflicts or data corruption.
   <br></br><br></br>
5. Implement Locking and Concurrency Control:<br></br>
   - Explore mechanisms such as locking, isolation levels, and concurrency control algorithms to prevent conflicts and maintain data consistency in multi-user environments.
   <br></br><br></br>
6. Manage Transaction Logs:<br></br>
   - Understand the importance of transaction logs in recording and recovering from failures and how to manage them effectively.
   <br></br><br></br>

Studying transactions in DBMS is essential for anyone working with databases, as it forms the foundation for reliable and secure data management in a wide range of applications and industries.</p>
