			<h1>Aim of Learning Normalization in DBMS</h1><br></br>

The aim of learning normalization in Database Management Systems (DBMS) is to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to design and structure databases efficiently, ensuring data integrity, reducing redundancy, and optimizing data management. By achieving this aim, individuals can create well-organized and robust database schemas that support data consistency, accuracy, and scalability.
<br></br><br></br><br></br>
<h1>Objectives of Learning Normalization in DBMS</h1><br></br>
<br></br>
1. Understand Database Design Fundamentals:<br></br>
   - To grasp the fundamental concepts of database design, including the structure of relational databases, tables, attributes, and relationships.
   <br></br><br></br>
2. Comprehend Data Anomalies:<br></br>
   - To recognize and comprehend data anomalies, such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies, that can occur in unnormalized or poorly normalized databases.
   <br></br><br></br>
3. Learn Normalization Principles:<br></br>
   - To learn the principles and techniques of normalization, including First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), Third Normal Form (3NF), Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF), and beyond.
   <br></br><br></br>
4. Achieve Data Consistency:<br></br>
   - To understand how normalization helps maintain data consistency by eliminating data redundancy and ensuring that data is stored in an organized and efficient manner.
   <br></br><br></br>
5. Reduce Redundancy:<br></br>
   - To acquire the skills needed to identify and eliminate data redundancy, which can lead to storage inefficiency and data inconsistency.
